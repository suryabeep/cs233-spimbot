To start, we decided to implement the random walk solution as a quick 70 points.
Simultaneously, we worked on solving puzzles to get the puzzlecoins.

## Usage of Minibots:
 - We rely on one specific idea for our method of winning. Swarming
    - The general idea is that if we can afford it and if there aren't enough minibots in the map then we will spawn a basic minibot.
    - This also means that we will need to create one silo. The reason behind this so that we can handle the randomness of these basic bots
    - The goal is that with the randomness of the basic bots they will either be on the offensive with our opponents and or go to our silo which we used to build our advanced bots with.
    - Hopefully if this goes well then kernels will work well
